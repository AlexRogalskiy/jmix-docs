== Creating calculated attribute for entities

Now, we need to create an auto calculated attribute for the talk’s end date and time. First add the getter method with `LocalDateTime` return type to the `Talk` class and name it `getEndDate()`. We also need to add `@JmixProperty` annotation for this method, so it is treated as read-only `endDate` attribute by Jmix. For the calculated attribute, we need to specify the fields to be loaded. In our case, these are `startDate` and `duration`. To specify these properties as required for the calculated attribute, we need to use the annotation `@DependsOnProperties`. After creating the method header, we can just add the calculation logic.

----
@JmixProperty
@DependsOnProperties({"startDate", "duration"})
public LocalDateTime getEndDate() {
    return (startDate != null && duration != null) ? startDate.plusHours(duration) : null;
}
----

Notice that Studio highlights the method because we need to specify a text label for the attribute. Put the cursor on the method name and press *Alt+Enter* (*⌘+n* in Mac) and create the message text in the message bundle.

In the dialog, set property name "End date"

In the previous section - "link:creating-data-model.adoc[Creating application's data model]", for the `Speaker` entity we have defined `lastName` as an entity's instance display name. Now we can define a method that will use a speaker's full name to display them in the UI.

To do this, we need to create a new method - `getFullName()` in the `Speaker` class and make its return type `String`. Then we need to move (cut and paste) annotation `@InstanceName` from `lastName` field to this method and add `@DependsOnProperties` annotation to use `firstName` and `lastName` fields in the method. Then all we need to do is to generate full speaker's name in the method body.

----
@InstanceName
@DependsOnProperties({"firstName", "lastName"})
public String getFullName() {
    return String.format("%s %s", firstName, lastName);
}

That’s it. Our domain model has been created with calculated fields.
