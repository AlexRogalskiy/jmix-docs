= Background Tasks

Use background tasks mechanism to perform tasks asynchronously without blocking the user interface.

[[basics]]
== Basics
To use background tasks, do the following:

1. Define a task as an inheritor of the `BackgroundTask` abstract class. Pass a link to a screen controller associated with the task and the task timeout to the task constructor.
2. Closing the screen will interrupt the tasks associated with it. Additionally, the task will be interrupted automatically after the specified timeout.
3. Actual actions performed by the task are implemented in the `run()` method.
4. Create an object of `BackgroundTaskHandler` class controlling the task bypassing the task instance to the `handle()` method of the `BackgroundWorker` bean. You can obtain a link to `BackgroundWorker` by injection in a screen controller or through the `AppBeans` class.
5. Run the task by invoking the `execute()` method of `BackgroundTaskHandler`.

[WARNING]
UI components' state and data containers must not be read/updated from `BackgroundTask` `run()` method: use `done()`, `progress()`, and `canceled()` callbacks instead. When you try to set a value to the UI component from a background thread, an `IllegalConcurrentAccessException` will be thrown.

See usage example on the xref:vcl/components/progress-bar.adoc#determinate-process[progress bar] page.

[[background-task]]
== BackgroundTask

`BackgroundTask<T, V>` is a parameterized class:

1. `T` − the type of objects displaying task progress. Objects of this type are passed to the task’s `progress()` method during an invocation of `TaskLifeCycle.publish()` in the working thread.

2. `V` − task result type passed to the `done()` method. You can also obtain the result by invoking `BackgroundTaskHandler.getResult()` method, which will wait for a task to complete.

`BackgroundTask` objects are stateless. If you did not create fields for temporary data when implementing task class, you could start several parallel processes using a single task instance.

[[background-task-methods]]
== BackgroundTask Methods

Detailed information about methods is provided in JavaDocs for `BackgroundTask`, `TaskLifeCycle`, `BackgroundTaskHandler` classes.

[[run]]
=== run()

This method of task should support external interruptions. To ensure this check the `TaskLifeCycle.isInterrupted()` flag periodically during long processes and stop execution when needed. Additionally, you should not silently discard `InterruptedException` (or any other exception) - instead, you should either exit the method correctly or not handle the exception at all.

You can also check whether the task was interrupted by the `cancel()` method or not, using the `isCancelled()` method.

[[canceled]]
=== canceled()

This method is invoked only during a controlled cancellation of a task, for example, when the `cancel()` method is invoked in the `TaskHandler`.

[[progress]]
=== progress()

This method is invoked when the progress value change. For example, after calling the `taskLifeCycle.publish()` method.

[[done]]
=== done()

This method is invoked when the task is completed.

[[handle-timeout-exception]]
=== handleTimeoutException()

This method is invoked when the task timeout expires. If the window where the task is running closes, the task is stopped without notification.

[[handle-exception]]
=== handleException()

This method is invoked when any exceptions occur.

[[notes-and-tips]]
== Notes & Tips

1. Use `dialogs.createBackgroundWorkDialog()` method to show a modal window with a progress indicator and *Cancel* button. You can define progress indication type and allow or prohibit the cancellation of the background task for the window.

//todo BackgroundTaskWrapper
// Ни Глеб, ни Роман не знают каким классом был заменен BackgroundTaskWrapper. Сказали уточнить у Влада, но он пока что в отпуске. Как выйдет надо будет поправить и сделать usage example.
// 2. `BackgroundHandler` object `execute()` method can only be started once. If you need to restart a task frequently, use `BackgroundTaskWrapper` class.
+
2. If you need to use certain values of visual components in the task thread, you should implement their acquisition in the `getParams()` method, which runs in the UI thread once a task starts. In the `run()` method, these parameters will be accessible via the `getParams()` method of the `TaskLifeCycle` object.
3. Background tasks are affected by xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-backgroundTaskTimeoutCheckInterval[jmix.ui.backgroundTaskTimeoutCheckInterval] and xref:app-properties.adoc#jmix-ui-background-task-threadsCount[jmix.ui.background-task.threadsCount] application properties.

[[usage-example]]
== Usage Example

Often, when launching a background task, you need to display a simple user interface:

1. To show to the user that the requested action is in the process of execution.
2. To allow the user to abort the requested long operation.
3. To show operation progress if progress percent can be determined.

Platform satisfies these needs with `dialogs.createBackgroundWorkDialog()` method.

Consider the following development task as an example:

1. A given screen contains a table displaying a list of customers, with multi-selection enabled.
2. When the user presses a button, the system should send reminder emails to selected customers, without blocking UI and with the ability to cancel the operation.

<1> Launch the task, show progress dialog, and set its options:
- dialog caption;
- dialog message;
- total number of elements for progress bar;
- show progress in percent or not;
- show *Cancel* button or not.
<2> Task progress unit is `Integer` - the number of processed table items, and result type is `Void` because this task doesn’t produce the result.
<3> Selected table items are saved into a variable that is initialized in the task constructor. This is necessary because the `run()` method is executed in a background thread and cannot access UI components.
<4> Set timeout to 10 minutes.
<5> Periodically check `isCancelled()` to stop the task immediately after pressing the *Cancel* dialog button.
<6> Send email. See more about email sending xref:email:index.adoc[here].
<7> Update progress bar position after every email sent.
