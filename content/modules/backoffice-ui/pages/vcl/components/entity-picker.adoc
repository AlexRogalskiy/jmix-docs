= Entity Picker

An entity picker displays an xref:data-model:entities.adoc[entity] instance in a text field and performs actions when the user clicks buttons on the right.

Component's XML-name: `entityPicker`.

== Basics

Use an entity picker if:

* The field value is a reference to an entity instance.
* The user needs to select or create an entity instance via the lookup screen or enter a custom value.
* The user needs to open the edit screen for a related entity instance.

By default, the Jmix Studio generates an entity picker when creating an entity editor screen with a reference attribute.

In the following example, the screen defines the `orderDc` data container for the `Order` entity having the `customer` attribute. In the `entityPicker` element, the `dataContainer` attribute contains a link to the `orderDc` data container, and the `property` attribute includes the name of the `customer` entity attribute. The entity attribute should refer to another entity. In the following example, it is `Customer`.

[WARNING]
====
For an entity picker's proper operation, you need either set the `metaClass` attribute or simultaneously set the `dataContainer` and `property` attributes.

[[actions]]
== Actions

You can define custom and predefined actions for an entity picker displayed as buttons on the right.
You can do it either in the XML descriptor using the `actions` nested element or programmatically in the controller using the `addAction()` method.

[[predefined-actions]]
=== Predefined Actions

When the Jmix Studio generates an entity picker in the editor screen, it also generates two predefined standard actions: `entity_lookup` and `entity_clear`. There are also the `entity_open` and `entity_open_composition` actions.

Use the `type` and `id` attributes for declaring predefined action in XML.

If you create an entity picker without actions, the XML loader will define only the `entity_lookup` and `entity_clear` actions. To add other predefined action, for example, the `entity_open`, you should specify the `actions` element as follows:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/entityPicker-screen.xml[tags=entityPicker3actions]
----

The `action` element does not extend but overrides a set of standard actions. You should define the identifiers of all required actions explicitly.

Use `addAction()` to set standard actions programmatically. If the component is defined in the XML descriptor without `actions` nested element, it is sufficient to add missing actions:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerScreen.java[tags=addAction;addAction2]
----

[[custom-actions]]
=== Custom Actions

To define a custom action in XML, use the `actions` nested element. Specify the `id` and `icon` attributes for the `action`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/entityPicker-screen.xml[tags=customAction]
----

Then implement custom logic in the screen controller by subscribing to `Action.ActionPerformedEvent`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerScreen.java[tags=customerEntityPicker;customAction]
----

<1> The `@Subscribe` annotation contains the entity picker `id` and the `id` of the action separated by a dot.

[TIP]
====
You can generate the `Action.ActionPerformedEvent` handler implementation methodâ€™s stub using the JMIX Studio.
====

[[meta-class]]
== MetaClass

You can use an entity picker without binding to entities, that is, without setting `dataContainer` and `property`. In this case, the `metaClass` attribute should be used to specify an entity type for an entity picker. For example:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/entityPicker-screen.xml[tags=metaclass]
----

You can get an instance of a selected entity by injecting the component into a controller and invoking its `getValue()` method.

[[icons]]
== Setting Icons

An entity picker can have an icon on the left. Just install `fieldIconProvider` in the screen controller to implement your custom logic:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerScreen.java[tags=fieldIconProvider]
----

<1> implementation of the `fieldIconProvider` delegate method.

See xref:icons.adoc[] for more information on working with icons.

[[fieldEditable]]
== Entering a Custom Value

By default, a user cannot input the value manually. If you set the `fieldEditable` attribute to `true`, you enable manual input. It can be useful when creating an entity instance based on the custom user-entered value.

Keep in mind the entered value is not set to the data model. To handle user input, use the `FieldValueChangeEvent` listener.

Look at the example below. We have the `Address` entity with the association `country` attribute referenced the `Country` entity. The `Country` entity has only one `name` attribute. Let's define the `ageValuePicker` in the XML-descriptor with `fieldEditable="true"`:

[source, xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/sample/screen/address/address-edit.xml[tags=fieldEditable]
----

Now the user can input the value manually. To handle this value, interpreted as String, subscribe to the `FieldValueChangeEvent` in the controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/sample/screen/address/AddressEdit.java[tags=field-value-change]
----

<1> The `@Subscribe` annotation contains the entity picker id.
<2> Get the entered value from the event object.
<3> Create a new instance of the `Country` entity in memory.
<4> Set the created instance to the field.
<5> Save the created `Country` instance to the data store before commit.
<6> Set the created instance as the value of the `country` attribute of the `Address` edited entity.


[[programmatically-creating]]
== Creating an Entity Picker Programmatically

To create an entity picker in the controller, use the `UiComponents` factory. Keep in mind the programmatically created entity picker will get no default actions, and you need to add all necessary actions explicitly:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/sample/screen/component/entitypicker/EntityPickerScreen.java[tags=userPicker1;userPicker2;userPicker3]
----
