= ResponsiveGridLayout

`ResponsiveGridLayout` is a container where the components are laid out on a grid, based on Bootstrap's 12 columns grid system (see Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid[doc^]).

Component's XML-name: `responsiveGridLayout`.

[[basics]]
== Basics

The main feature of this container is that it is fully responsive. The arrangement of the components located inside the `ResponsiveGridLayout` will automatically change depending on the size of the window.

[WARNING]
====

Note that `ResponsiveGridLayout` is based on a media query. That means that the size is adjusted depending on the browser window's size and not on the size of the container on the screen.

====

[NOTE]
====

For a more evident demonstration of the capabilities of the `ResponsiveGridLayout`, we used the following styles:

[source,css,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/themes/helium-extended/helium-extended.scss[tags=start;responsive-grid-layout-style;end]
----

To learn more about styles, see the xref:themes/custom_theme.adoc[custom theme] page.

[[breakpoints]]
== Breakpoints

Bootstrapâ€™s grid includes five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.

Breakpoint representing minimum viewport widths used in media query ranges. They apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it when used. There are the following possible breakpoints:

[[xs]]
1. `xs` - extra-small devices, with width less than `576px`. The default value in Bootstrap.
+

[[sm]]
2. `sm` - small devices, with width between `576px` and `768px`.
+

[[md]]
3. `md` - medium devices, with width between `768px` and `992px`.
+

[[lg]]
4. `lg` - large devices, with width between `768px` and `1200px`.
+

[[xl]]
5. `xl` - extra-large devices, with width `1200px` and up.

Breakpoints are applied hierarchically. For example, `sm` applies to small, medium, large, and extra-large devices, but not extra-small devices, represented by the first `xs` breakpoint.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=breakpoints]
----

When the screen is wide enough, the contents of the `ResponsiveGridLayout` looks like this:

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-breakpoints-1.png[align="center"]

As the screen narrows, the content will first look like this:

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-breakpoints-2.png[align="center"]

and then like this:

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-breakpoints-3.png[align="center"]


[[col-element]]
== Col Element

[[equal-width]]
=== Equal-width

You can define columns without explicit values like `xs="6"`. If `cols` have no explicit values, then every column will be the same width at every viewport, from `xs` to `xl`.

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=equal-width]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-equal-width.png[align="center"]

[[setting-one-column-width]]
=== Setting One Column Width

Auto-layout for flexbox grid columns also means you can set the `width` of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=one-column-width]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-one-column-width.png[align="center"]

[[variable-width-content]]
=== Variable Width Content

Use `{<<breakpoints,breakpoint>>}="AUTO"` attributes to size columns based on the natural `width` of their content.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=variable-width-content]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-variable-width.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====

The `DEFAULT` breakpoint value represents the case when no explicit column value is defined and equal-width columns will be created. In terms of Bootstrap it equivalent to :

* `xs="DEFAULT"` equals `.col`
* `sm="DEFAULT"` equals `.col-sm`
* etc.

====

[[row-element]]
== Row Element

[[cols-attributes]]
=== Cols Attributes

The following attributes define the number of columns in the `row` at a specific breakpoint:

[[cols]]
* `cols`

[[cols-lg]]
* `colsLg`

[[cols-md]]
* `colsMd`

[[cols-sm]]
* `colsSm`

[[cols-xl]]
* `colsXl`

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=row-columns-2]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-row-columns-2.png[align="center"]

[[gutters-enable]]
=== guttersEnable attribute

By default, `guttersEnable="true"`. To disable gutters, use the `guttersEnable` attribute and set it to `false`. It removes the negative margins from the `row` and the horizontal padding from all immediate children columns.

[[alignment]]
== Alignment

[[vertical]]
=== Vertical

[[entire-row-alignment]]
==== Entire Row Alignment

You can align the entire `row` vertically using the following attributes at a specific breakpoint:

[[align-items]]
* `alignItems`

[[align-items-lg]]
* `alignItemsLg`

[[align-items-md]]
* `alignItemsMd`

[[align-items-sm]]
* `alignItemsSm`

[[align-items-xl]]
* `alignItemsXl`

For the listed above attributes, there are the following possible values:

* `BASELINE` - every `col` in a `row` is aligned as their baselines align
* `CENTER` - every `col` in a `row` is centered
* `END` - every `col` in a `row` is aligned to the bottom
* `START` - every `col` in a `row` is aligned to the top
* `STRETCH` - every `col` in a `row` is stretched to the full height of the row

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=align-items]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-align-items.png[align="center"]

[[specific-col-alignment]]
==== Specific Col Alignment

You can also align the `col` you need using the following attributes at a specific breakpoint:

[[align-self]]
* `alignSelf`

[[align-self-lg]]
* `alignSelfLg`

[[align-self-md]]
* `alignSelfMd`

[[align-self-sm]]
* `alignSelfSm`

[[align-self-xl]]
* `alignSelfXl`

For the listed above attributes, there are the following possible values:

* `AUTO`
* `BASELINE` - `col` is aligned as its baseline is aligned
* `CENTER` - `col` is centered
* `END` - `col` is aligned to the bottom
* `START` - `col` is aligned to the top
* `STRETCH` - `col` is stretched to the full height of the row

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=align-self]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-align-self.png[align="center"]

[[horizontal]]
=== Horizontal

For horizontal alignment, you can use following attributes at a specific breakpoint:

[[justify-content]]
* `justifyContent`

[[justify-content-lg]]
* `justifyContentLg`

[[justify-content-md]]
* `justifyContentMd`

[[justify-content-sm]]
* `justifyContentSm`

[[justify-content-xl]]
* `justifyContentXl`

For the listed above attributes, there are the following possible values:

* `AROUND` - there are indents on the left, right, and between the `cols`
* `BETWEEN` - there are indents between the `cols`
* `CENTER` - `cols` inside the `row` are centered
* `END` - `cols` inside the `row` aligned to the right
* `START` - `cols` inside the `row` aligned to the left

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=justify-content]
----

image::vcl/containers/responsive-layout-justify-content.png[align="center"]

* `order`

[[order-lg]]
* `orderLg`

[[order-md]]
* `orderMd`

[[order-sm]]
* `orderSm`

[[order-xl]]
* `orderXl`

As a value for the listed above attributes, you can define either a particular number or one of the predefined values: `FIRST` or `LAST`.

First example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/ui/ex1/screen/containers/responsivegridlayout/responsive-grid-layout-screen.xml[tags=reordering-1]

[[offset-title]]
== Offset

The following attributes allow you to move `cols` to the right at a specific breakpoint:

[[offset]]
* `offset`

[[offset-lg]]
* `offsetLg`

[[offset-md]]
* `offsetMd`

[[offset-sm]]
* `offsetSm`

[[offset-xl]]
* `offsetXl`

For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]

[[container-types]]
== Container Types

`ResponsiveGridLayout` has two possible types:

* `FLUID` - a full-width container that is spanning the entire width of the viewport. This is the default type.
* `FIXED` - a fixed-width container, meaning its `max-width` changes at each breakpoint.
