= Themes

Themes are used to manage the visual presentation of the application.

A theme consists of https://sass-lang.com/[SCSS] files and other resources like images.

Jmix provides xref:themes/theme_usage.adoc[built-in compiled themes] for convenience and demo purposes. In real projects, themes must be customized. A xref:themes/custom_theme.adoc[custom theme] allows you to modify a built-in theme on the project level. You can also create a project with the xref:themes/theme_addon.adoc[theme add-on].
