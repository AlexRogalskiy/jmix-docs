= Administration Screens

BPM add-on provides administration screens for modeling and managing processes.

== Modeler

This screen contains a canvas for modeling processes and a panel with process elements on the left. To configure process elements, select them on the canvas and set properties in the properties panel on the right.

=== Pools and Lanes

Using pools and lanes element you can define assignees for all user tasks on the lane. Every user task on the lane without an explicitly defined assignee will inherit the assignee value from the lane.

To display the properties panel for the lane, select the lane on the canvas. In the example below, the `manager` process variable is assigned to the selected lane `Manager`.

To display the process properties for the model with the added pool element you need to click on the header of the pool element.

=== Model Drafts

When you click the *Deploy process* button (1) in the buttons panel, the process will be deployed to the Flowable engine and will be available for starting. If you don’t want it to be deployed and just want to save the process to get back to it later, use the *Save draft* (3) button. To open a draft, use the *Open draft* (2) button.

[[process-definitions]]
== Process Definitions

This screen contains a list of processes and allows you to open them in modeler, view details, upload BPMN XML or start processes.

Click *View details* button to open *Process definition editor* that displays process definition properties, BPMN XML, active process instances of the selected process definition version. To change the process definition version, use the *Version* combo box field.

From the editor, you can suspend the process definition. In this case, the process will not be available for starting until you activate it. In the suspend process definition dialog, you have an option to suspend running process instances as well. In this case, user tasks of suspended instances won’t be displayed in the tasks list, all timers and jobs won’t be executed.

Also, you can migrate process instances. See xref:bpm:instance-migration.adoc[Process Instances Migration] section.

[[process-instances]]
== Process Instances

This screen can display both active and completed process instances. To switch between them, change the value of the *State* combo box in the filter and click the *Apply* button.

In the *Process instance editor* screen, you can xref:bpm:instance-migration.adoc[migrate] an instance to a new process definition version, suspend an instance or remove it.

The *Runtime* tab is available only for active process instances and contains information about the current process state: execution tree, variable values, active user tasks, and failed jobs.

Selecting items in the executions tree will modify content of the *Variables* and *Tasks* tabs. If you select a particular execution, only objects related to this execution will be displayed.

Using the *Variables* tab, you can create, modify and remove process variables. Note, that when an execution is selected in the tree, a new variable will be put to the selected execution.

In the *Tasks* tab, you can view a list of active tasks and reassign tasks to other users.

The *Failed jobs* tab displays the list of jobs that failed with an error. For example, if some service task method threw an exception, this service task will appear in the failed jobs list. In the UI, you can view the exception stacktrace and restore the failed job after the cause of the error is fixed.

The *History* tab contains a list of all user tasks (completed and active), a full list of completed activities and last values of process variables. The *History* tab is available both for active and for completed process instances.

The *Diagram* tab displays a process model with the highlighted active node.

[[user-groups]]
== User Groups

In the *User groups* screen, you can manage groups of users to define them later as candidates for xref:bpm:user-task.adoc#task-candidate-users-and-groups[user task] assignees. A user can be a member of several groups. 

A group can have one of the following types:

* *Users*. For the group of *Users* type, users should be explicitly selected.
* *Roles*. For the group of *Roles* type, a set of security roles should be defined. Users are considered to be a member of the user group if they have one of the selected roles.
* *All users*. Group of this type automatically contains all users.

== User Tasks

This screen displays all active user tasks. On the top of the screen, you can filter tasks using various criteria: process definition, task assignee, candidate user, or candidate group.

For example, using this screen you can find all tasks assigned to a user and reassign them to another one.
