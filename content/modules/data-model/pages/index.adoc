= Data Model

Development of a business application usually starts from designing its data model.

In Jmix, the application data is represented by xref:entities.adoc[entities]. Each entity with its attributes is reflected in the application xref:metadata.adoc[metadata] which is used by the framework mechanisms to get a comprehensive information about the data model.

An entity can be stored in an external storage or exist purely in memory. In both cases, an entity is associated with a xref:data-stores.adoc[data store], which is an abstraction over a data source in Jmix applications.

An entity can have references to other entities, even if they are from different data stores. It allows you to create an integral data model comprising data from multiple databases or even from sources of different nature, like no-SQL databases or REST APIs.
