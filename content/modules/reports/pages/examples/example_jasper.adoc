== Sample JRXML Report

The example is also based on the sample *Library* application, which source code is available on https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-library-cuba7[GitHub].

First of all, install Reporting Add-on by following xref:index.adoc#installation[installation] instruction.

Open the *Reports* -> *Reports* screen and click on the *Import* button to import the report. Choose Reports.zip in the project root directory. Two reports will appear in the table, one of them will be Book availability in department. This report displays the list of book publications in the selected department; the default output format is XLS. Let's create the new JasperReports template for this report.

. <<structure,Report data structure>>.
+
--
.Report data structure

Let's consider report bands.

* *Header* band – report header. It contains the dataset with the Groovy script which outputs the report <<parameters, external parameters>> value:
+
[source, groovy]
----
[['library_department_name' : params['library_department'].name]]
----

* *Data* band outputs the list of book instances in the department passed as a parameter by running the following Groovy script:
+
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/example_jasper.groovy[]
----
+
This query uses the external report parameter – `library_department`. The parameter has the *Entity* type, however you can compare it directly with entity identifier fields; the conversion will be done automatically.
--

. Report <<parameters, parameters>>.
+
The *Parameters and Formats* tab contains one declared report external parameter – `Department`:
+
.Report parameters

+
When running the report, the user will have to enter this parameter. The department selection will be performed via the `library$LibraryDepartment.browse` screen, available in the application.

. Report <<template_jasper, template>>.
+
--
The *Templates* tab contains a single defined XLS template, loaded from `BookAvailability.xls`.

Create the new JRXML file with the following content:

[source, xml]
.BookAvailability.jrxml
----
include::{sourcesdir}/jasper.jrxml[]
----

The table in this template is bound to a subDataset. The `title` element uses the *Header* band data directly. You can open the template file in JasperReports visual designer to see the report layout.

Upload the new template to the application, selecting any output type, and make it default:

<<running, Run>> the report to make sure it works:
