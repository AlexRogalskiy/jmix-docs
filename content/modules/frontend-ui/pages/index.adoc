= Frontend UI

The Frontend UI is an alternative to the Backoffice UI. Whereas Backoffice UI is designed primarily for internal users, Frontend UI is targeted for external users and is more flexible in terms of layout customization. It also uses different technologies which are more familiar to frontend developers, and allows easy integration of UI libraries and components from vast JavaScript ecosystem. However, it requires better knowledge of modern frontend stack.
