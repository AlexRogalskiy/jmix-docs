= File Storage Usage

There is an ability to store email body text and attachments in File Storage instead of BLOB columns in database.

To use File Storage:

. Add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/build.gradle[tags=fs-dependency]
----
+
. Enable File Storage usage and configure default File Storage. Set in `application.properties` file:
+
[source, properties]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=fs-enable]
----
