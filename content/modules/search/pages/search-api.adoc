= Search API

image:search:search_architecture.png[Architecture Diagram, align="center"]

Search consists of the following components:

* *Startup Index Synchronizer* - automatically validates and recreates irrelevant\missing indexes on application startup. Starts background process with enqueueing all instances of entities related to created indexes.
* *Entity Tracking Listener* - tracks changes of indexed entities and enqueues corresponding queue items.
* *Quartz Scheduler* - schedules job that periodically processes items of the Indexing Queue.
* *Indexing Queue Manager* - enqueues items to the Indexing Queue. Processes previously enqueued items and performs corresponding actions via the Entity Indexer.
* *Entity Indexer* - performs operations with index data: saves and deletes entity instances.
* *ES Index Manager* - manages index metadata: creates and drops indexes, validates mappings.
* *Entity Searcher* - performs searching in indexes and retrieves the search result that can be rendered on a screen.

Indexing workflow:

* Every change (create\update\remove) of indexed entities is tracked via the Entity Tracking Listener and enqueued as a queue item.
* Scheduled execution of the Indexing Queue Manager extracts the next batch of queue items and processes them - saves or deletes the corresponding document in the index.

== Indexing API

If you want to index/delete entity instances directly without enqueuing an event you should use methods of `EntityIndexer`:

* `index(Object entityInstance)` - stores a provided entity instance to index.
* `indexCollection(Collection<Object> entityInstances)` - stores provided entity instances to index.
* `indexByEntityId(Id entityId)` - stores entity instance to index by a provided id.
* `indexCollectionByEntityIds(Collection<Id> entityIds)` - stores entity instances to index by provided ids.
* `delete(Object entityInstance)` - deletes a provided entity instance from index.
* `deleteCollection(Collection<Object> entityInstances)` - deletes provided entity instances from index
* `deleteByEntityId(Id entityId)` - deletes entity instance from the index by a provided id.
* `deleteCollectionByEntityIds(Collection<Id> entityIds)` - deletes entity instances from index by provided ids.

If you want to enqueue instances to be indexed/deleted you should use methods of `IndexingQueueManager`:

* `enqueueIndex(Object entityInstance)` - enqueues index event for a provided entity instance.
* `enqueueIndexCollection(Collection<Object> entityInstances)` - enqueues index events for provided entity instances.
* `enqueueIndexByEntityId(Id entityId)` - enqueues index event for a provided entity id.
* `enqueueIndexCollectionByEntityIds(Collection<Id> entityIds)` - enqueues index events for provided entity ids.
* `enqueueIndexAll()` - enqueues index events for all instances of all entities configured for indexing.
* `enqueueIndexAll(String entityName)` - enqueues index events for all instances of a provided entity. This entity should be previously configured for indexing.
* `enqueueDelete(Object entityInstance)` - enqueues delete event for a provided entity instance.
* `enqueueDeleteCollection(Collection<Object> entityInstances)` - enqueues delete events for provided entity instances.
* `enqueueDeleteByEntityId(Id entityId)` - enqueues delete event for a provided entity id.
* `enqueueDeleteCollectionByEntityIds(Collection<Id> entityIds)` - enqueues delete events for provided entity ids.
* `emptyQueue(String entityName)` - removes all queue items related to a provided entity from the indexing queue.
* `processNextBatch()` - retrieves the next batch of items from the indexing queue and processes them.
* `processNextBatch(int batchSize)` - retrieves the next batch (with size equals to `batchSize`) of items from the indexing queue and processes them.
* `processEntireQueue()` - retrieves all items from indexing queue and processes them.

== Searching API

If you want to search entities in the index, you should use methods of `EntitySearcher`:

* `SearchResult search(SearchContext searchContext, SearchStrategy searchStrategy)` - performs searching in search indexes according to provided `SearchContext` and `SearchStrategy`. 
* `search(SearchContext searchContext)` - similar to the previous one but uses the default `SearchStrategy`.
* `searchNextPage(SearchResult previousSearchResult)` - performs a search for the next page based on `SearchResult` of the previous search request. Returns its own `SearchResult` that can be used for the next invocation.

The returned `SearchResult` object contains the result data:

* `SearchContext` - describes the main settings of the current search:

** `searchText` - the text you want to search.
** `size` - the maximum amount of documents that should be found.
** `offset` - the number of documents that should be skipped.
** `entities` - a collection of entity names that should be found. If none is specified, the search will be performed within all indexed entities.
* `SearchStrategy` - describes the way of `searchText` processing.

Also, you can use `SearchResult` to load a collection of related entity instances. For that purpose, you should use methods of `SearchResultProcessor:`

* `Collection<Object> loadEntityInstances(SearchResult searchResult)`
* `Collection<Object> loadEntityInstances(SearchResult searchResult, Map<String, FetchPlan> fetchPlans)`

[[search-mbean]]
== Search MBean

Search provides the following operations within MBean:

* `enqueueIndexAll` - enqueues all instances of indexed entities. There are two variants of this operation:

** with parameter `entityName` - enqueues instances of this entity only.
** without parameters - enqueues all instances of all indexed entities.
* `processEntireIndexingQueue` - processes all items in Indexing Queue.
* `processIndexingQueueNextBatch` - processes next batch of items in Indexing Queue.
* `recreateIndex` - drops and creates index related to a provided entity. All data will be lost.
* `recreateIndexes` - drops and creates all search indexes defined in the application. All data will be lost.
* `synchronizeIndexSchema` - synchronizes schema of index related to a provided entity. This may cause deletion of this index with all data - depends on schema management strategy.
* `synchronizeIndexSchemas` - synchronizes schemas of all search indexes defined in the application. This may cause deletion of indexes with all their data - depends on schema management strategy.
* `validateIndex` - validates schema of search index related to a provided entity and displays a status.
* `validateIndexes` - validates schemas of all search indexes defined in the application and displays status for all indexes.
