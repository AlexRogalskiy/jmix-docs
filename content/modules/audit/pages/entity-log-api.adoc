= Entity Log API

The add-on tracks entity persistence at the entity listeners level, so it is guaranteed to track all changes passing through persistent context of the xref:data-access:entity-manager.adoc[EntityManager]. Direct changes to entities in the database using SQL are not tracked.

Modified entity instances are passed to `registerCreate()`, `registerModify()` and `registerDelete()` methods of the `EntityLog` bean before they are saved to the database. Each method has `auto` parameter, allowing separation of automatic logs added by entity listeners from manual logs added by calling these methods from the application code. When these methods are called from entity listeners the value of `auto` parameter is `true`.

Log entries are stored in the `AUDIT_ENTITY_LOG` table corresponding to the `EntityLogItem` entity. Changed attribute values are stored in the `CHANGES` column and are converted to instances of `EntityLogAttr` entity.
