= Entity Log

Entity Log is a mechanism for tracking changes in your JPA entities. It records changes in entity attributes and provides a user interface for searching and displaying information about the changes:

* What entity instance was changed.
* Old and new values of changed attributes.
* When the entity was changed.
* Which user changed the entity.
